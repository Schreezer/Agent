# 🧪 Claude Code Capabilities Test Cases

## Now the Main Model Knows Claude Code Can Handle:

### 📁 **File Operations**
- "Read the package.json file"
- "Create a new configuration file"
- "Search for TODO comments in the codebase"
- "Delete old log files"

### 💻 **Development Tasks**
- "Fix the authentication bug"
- "Write unit tests for the API"
- "Refactor the database connection code"
- "Set up a new React project"

### 🌐 **Web & API Tasks**
- "Fetch data from the GitHub API"
- "Scrape product prices from a website"
- "Test the REST API endpoints"
- "Download files from URLs"

### ⚙️ **System Operations**
- "Install the latest dependencies"
- "Run the test suite"
- "Deploy to production"
- "Configure the database"

### 📊 **Data Processing**
- "Analyze the CSV sales data"
- "Generate a report from logs"
- "Process JSON responses"
- "Convert XML to JSON"

### 🤖 **Automation**
- "Set up CI/CD pipeline"
- "Create a backup script"
- "Automate the deployment process"
- "Build a data processing workflow"

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

The main model should now **aggressively suggest Claude Code** for almost any technical task, knowing that Claude Code can handle:

- ✅ File system operations
- ✅ Web requests and API calls  
- ✅ System commands and automation
- ✅ Code development and debugging
- ✅ Data processing and analysis
- ✅ Complex multi-step workflows

## 🔄 **Test Flow:**

1. Send task → Main model suggests Claude Code
2. Accept → Claude Code executes with full capabilities
3. Questions → Smart routing (technical vs user-specific)
4. Completion → Task done with real file/system changes

**The main model is now Claude Code-aware!** 🚀
